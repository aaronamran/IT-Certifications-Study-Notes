### Microsoft Azure Fundamentals: Describe cloud concepts
- hybrid cloud > uses both public and private clouds in an inter-connected environment
- multi-cloud > multiple public cloud providers
- Azure Arc > set of tech that helps manage cloud environments
- Azure VMware Solution > migrate VMware workloads from private to public/hybrid cloud
- Cloud has high availability (uptime) and high scalability (scale on demand)
- Vertical scaling > Add more CPUs or RAM for processing power
- Horizontal scaling > Add additional VMs or containers
- Reliability > ability of system to recover from failures and continue to function
- Cloud has a decentralised design (regions around the world)
- Performance predictability > predicting resources needed to deliver a positive experience for customers (Autoscaling, load balancing and high availability)
- Cost predictability > forecasting the cost of cloud spending (Cloud analytics, Pricing Calculator, Total Cost of Ownership (TCO))
- Cloud features support governance and compliance
- Cloud is managed through web portal, CLI, APIs and PowerShell
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) > cloud provider maintains hardware, network connectivity and physical security. You are responsible for everything else: OS installation, configuration and maintenance; network configuration; database and storage configuration and so on
- Scenarios for IaaS > Lift-and-shift migration, testing and development
- Platform as a Service (PaaS) > cloud provider does all in IaaS and maintains OS, middleware, development tools and business intelligence services
- Scenarios for PaaS > Development framework, analytics or business intelligence
- Software as a Service (SaaS) > renting or using a fully developed application. Is the least flexible but easiest to run
- Scenarios for SaaS > Email and messaging, business productivity applications, finance and expense tracking


### Microsoft Azure Fundamentals: Describe Azure architecture and services
- Datacenters are grouped into Azure Regions or Azure Availability Zones
- Region is a geographical area that contains at least one or more datacenters that are nearby and networked together with a low-latency network
- Availability zones are physically separate datacenters within an Azure region. Each AZ is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling and networking. An availability zone is set up to be an isolation boundary. If one zone goes down, the other continues working. AZ are connected through high-speed, private fiber-optic networks
- AZ are primarily for VMs, managed disks, load balancers and SQL databases. 3 categories > zonal services (pin the resource to a specific zone), zone-redundant services (platform replicates automatically across zones) and non-regional services (services are always available from Azure geographies and are resilient to zone-wide outages as well as region-wide outages)
- Region pairs > Azure regions paired with another region within the same geography at least 300 miles away to allow for replication of resources across a geography that helps reduce the likelihood of interruptions that affects an entire region
- If an extensive Azure outage occurs, 1 region out of every pair is prioritised to make sure at least one is restored quickly as possible for applications hosted in that region pair. Planned Azure updates are rolled out to paired regions one region at a time to minimise downtime. Data continues to reside within the same geography as its pair for tax- and law-enforcement jurisdiction purposes
- Sovereign regions are instances of Azure that are isolated from the main instance of Azure (US DoD Central, US Gov Virginia, US Gov Iowa, and China East, China North (maintained through a unique partnership between MS and 21Vianet))
- Resource > anything created, provisioned and deployed
- Resource groups are groupings of resource. Actions applied to the group applies to all resources within the resource group
- Azure accounts can have multiple subscriptions to configure different billing models and apply different access-management policies
- VM scale sets > Azure automates creation and managing of identical, load-balanced VMs
- VM availability sets > ensure VMs stagger updates and have varied power and network connectivity, preventing losing all VMs with a single network or power failure. Has no additional cost
- Update domain > groups VMs that can be rebooted at the same time. This setup allows applying updates while knowing that only one update domain grouping is offline at a time
- Fault domain > groups VMs by common power source and network switch
- Azure Virtual Desktop > use cloud-hosted Windows VM from any location
- Azure Container Instances > run container in Azure, supports PaaS
- Azure Container Apps > does not have container management piece, supports PaaS and incorporates load balancing and scaling
- Azure Kubernetes Service > orchestration service to manage container lifecycle
- Azure Functions > event-driven, serverless compute that does not require maintaining VM or containers. Used when only concerned about code running service and not about underlying platform or infrastructure. Functions are commonly used when work is response to an event (often via a REST request), timer, or message from another Azure service. Azure Functions runs code when it triggers and automatically deallocates resources when the function is finished. Azure charges for CPU time used while function runs. Stateless (default) functions behave as if they restart everytime they respond to an event. Stateful (Durable Functions) functions have context passing through to track prior activity
- Azure App Service > HTTP-based service for building and hosting web apps, background jobs, mobile backends and RESTful APIs without managing infra
- Azure VPN Gateway > deployed in dedicated subnet of virtual network and enable site-to-site, point-to-site and network-to-network connection
- Policy-based VPN gateways > specify statically the IP address of packets that should be encrypted through each tunnel
- Route-based VPN gateways > IPSec tunnels are modeled as network interface or virtual tunnel interface. Preferred connection method for on-prem devices, more resilient to topology changes such as new subnet creation. Used for connections between virtual networks, point-to-site connections, multisite connections and coexistence with an Azure ExpressRoute gateway
- High-availability scenarios > Active/standby (when active instance is disrupted, standby instance automatically assumes responsibility), Active/active (due to support for BGP routing protocol, each instance has unique public IP address with separate tunnels from on-prem devices to each IP address), ExpressRoute failover (configure VPN gateway as secure failover path for ExpressRoute connections, but not immune to physical problems), Zone-redundant gateways (Used in regions that support AZ. It uses different gateway stock keeping units (SKUs) and use Standard public IP address instead of Basic public IP addresses)
- Azure ExpressRoute > extends on-prem networks into Microsoft cloud over a private connection with help of connectivity provider (ExpressRoute Circuit)
- Benefits of using ExpressRoute > connectivity to Microsoft cloud services across all regions in geopolitical region, global connectivity to Microsoft services across all regions with ExpressRoute Global Reach, dynamic routing between network and Microsoft via BGP and built-in redundancy in every peering location for higher reliability
- ExpressRoute connectivity models > colocation at a cloud exchange, point-to-point Ethernet connection, any-to-any networks, directly from ExpressRoute sites
- Azure DNS > hosting service for DNS domains that provides name resolution by using Microsoft Azure infrastructure
- Azure storage provides unique namespace for Azure Storage data that's accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS
- Azure storage redundancy > Locally redundant storage (LRS - replicates data 3x within a single data center in primary region. Lowest-cost and least durability), Zone-redundant storage (ZRS - replicates Azure storage data synchronously across 3 Azure AZ in primary region. Recommended for scenarios that require high availability),
