<summary><h2>Identify the Characteristics of On-Premises Data Centers vs. Cloud</h2></summary>
  
- On-premises data centers:
  - Physically located within an organization's premises, are fully owned, operated, and maintained by the organization, encompassing all hardware, software, and networking equipment
  - Maintain full control over the infrastructure, encompassing servers, storage, networking devices, and security systems, allowing for customization and configuration tailored to their specific needs and preferences
  - Capital Expenditure (CapEx)
  - Scalability in on-premises data centers is hindered by physical limitations, leading to time-consuming processes like purchasing hardware and provisioning new circuits
  - Organizations control, own, and manage all aspects of security and compliance standards within their data centers. It includes responsibilities such as implementing physical security protocols, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and encryption protocols for data protection
  - Maintenance tasks, including hardware repairs, software updates, and system monitoring, are internally managed by IT staff or outsourced to third-party service providers, with organizations accountable for ensuring the uptime, reliability, and performance of the data center infrastructure
- Cloud computing services:
  - Hosted in remote off-premises data centers by third-party vendors, are subscribed to by organizations on a pay-as-you-go basis, eliminating the need for owning and maintaining physical infrastructure
  - Cloud providers oversee and administer the underlying infrastructure, encompassing servers, networking, storage, and virtualization technology, while users, although having limited control over physical hardware, can configure and manage resources via a web-based interface or API
  - Operational Expenditure (OpEx)
  - Cloud services provide virtually limitless scalability, enabling organizations to adjust resource levels in response to demand fluctuations. Users can provision additional resources on-demand or automatically scale according to predefined rules or triggers
  - Cloud service providers (CSPs) provide security as a shared security model. The cloud shared security model divides security responsibilities between the cloud service provider (CSP) and the customer, varying based on the service model (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS). CSPs are responsible for securing the cloud infrastructure and platform, while customers are tasked with securing their data, applications, and access management. This collaborative approach ensures both the infrastructure and the data it hosts are comprehensively protected against cyber threats
  - Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) provide maintenance and support by regularly updating and patching infrastructure and platforms to ensure the security and performance of the underlay infrastructure they own. They also offer customer service and technical support to address issues, provide guidance, and ensure optimal service utilization. This proactive approach helps minimize downtime and enhance the overall user experience. Users/customers, on their part, are responsible for managing their data, implementing security measures like encryption, and controlling access to their applications and services. This partnership ensures a smooth, secure cloud experience with minimized downtime and enhanced security

<summary><h2>Describe the Differences Between Private, Public, and Hybrid Clouds</h2></summary>

- On-prem infrastructure: Data Center, Very slow to respond to DevOps. Consists of physical and virtual resources within an organization’s own facilities, providing high security and control but requiring significant investment and ongoing maintenance
- Private Cloud: Single tenant cloud computing, Running on-prem infra. Provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization. It should provide capabilities such as on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service. Managed internally or by a third party, or some combination of them, ideal for sensitive data handling. It may exist on or off premises
- Hybrid Cloud: Public Cloud and Private, Cloud cooperating together. These combine on-premises or private clouds with public clouds
- Public Cloud: Multiple tenants, Hosted by Cloud Service Providers (CSP), Shared Infra. Operated by third-party providers, public clouds provide scalable and shared cloud computing resources accessible over the internet
  
<br />

- SaaS: service that is used for the pure consumption of software. You have no control and, therefore, no responsibility for the application - for example, Microsoft 365 or Salesforce
- PaaS: service where services are managed for you. You end up with a reduced level of control. For example, you can run a relational database service or platform without needing to install the underlying binaries or be responsible for hardening it, patching it, or even ensuring its uptime. You just need to bring your own code
- IaaS: service is where the CSP takes responsibility for the compute, storage, and networking service. The CSP abstracts the hypervisor and gives you access to the guest Virtual Machine (VM) or compute instance. You are responsible for the OS on that VM and all the libraries, middleware, and applications on that VM
