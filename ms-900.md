### Microsoft Azure Fundamentals: Describe cloud concepts
- hybrid cloud > uses both public and private clouds in an inter-connected environment
- multi-cloud > multiple public cloud providers
- Azure Arc > set of tech that helps manage cloud environments
- Azure VMware Solution > migrate VMware workloads from private to public/hybrid cloud
- Cloud has high availability (uptime) and high scalability (scale on demand)
- Vertical scaling > Add more CPUs or RAM for processing power
- Horizontal scaling > Add additional VMs or containers
- Reliability > ability of system to recover from failures and continue to function
- Cloud has a decentralised design (regions around the world)
- Performance predictability > predicting resources needed to deliver a positive experience for customers (Autoscaling, load balancing and high availability)
- Cost predictability > forecasting the cost of cloud spending (Cloud analytics, Pricing Calculator, Total Cost of Ownership (TCO))
- Cloud features support governance and compliance
- Cloud is managed through web portal, CLI, APIs and PowerShell
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) > cloud provider maintains hardware, network connectivity and physical security. You are responsible for everything else: OS installation, configuration and maintenance; network configuration; database and storage configuration and so on
- Scenarios for IaaS > Lift-and-shift migration, testing and development
- Platform as a Service (PaaS) > cloud provider does all in IaaS and maintains OS, middleware, development tools and business intelligence services
- Scenarios for PaaS > Development framework, analytics or business intelligence
- Software as a Service (SaaS) > renting or using a fully developed application. Is the least flexible but easiest to run
- Scenarios for SaaS > Email and messaging, business productivity applications, finance and expense tracking
