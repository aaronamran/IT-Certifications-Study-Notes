### Microsoft Azure Fundamentals: Describe cloud concepts
- hybrid cloud > uses both public and private clouds in an inter-connected environment
- multi-cloud > multiple public cloud providers
- Azure Arc > set of tech that helps manage cloud environments
- Azure VMware Solution > migrate VMware workloads from private to public/hybrid cloud
- Cloud has high availability (uptime) and high scalability (scale on demand)
- Vertical scaling > Add more CPUs or RAM for processing power
- Horizontal scaling > Add additional VMs or containers
- Reliability > ability of system to recover from failures and continue to function
- Cloud has a decentralised design (regions around the world)
- Performance predictability > predicting resources needed to deliver a positive experience for customers (Autoscaling, load balancing and high availability)
- Cost predictability > forecasting the cost of cloud spending (Cloud analytics, Pricing Calculator, Total Cost of Ownership (TCO))
- Cloud features support governance and compliance

### MS-900 Introduction to Microsoft 365: Describe Microsoft 365 security and compliance capabilities
- Microsoft Entra ID (fka Azure AD), is Microsoft's cloud-based IAM service. Used by organisations to enable employees, guests and others to sign in and access resources required
- Tenant > an instance of Microsoft Entra ID in which information about a single organisation resides including organisational objects such as users, groups, devices, and application registrations
- Directory > logical container within Microsoft Entra tenant that holds and organises various resources and objects related to IAM including users, groups, applications, devices, and other directory objects
- Multi-tenant > an organisation that has more than one instance of Microsoft Entra ID, due to having multiple independent subsidiaries, geographical boundaries and etc
- Microsoft Entra ID is used by IT admins to control access to corporate apps and resources, based on business requirements. Devs use Microsoft Entra ID as a standards-based approach for adding SSO to their apps. Subscribers to Azure services, Microsoft 365, or Dynamics 365 automatically have access to Microsoft Entra ID
- Assignable identities in Microsoft Entra ID > Human identities (internal users, external users (customers, consultants, vendors, partners)), physical devices (phones, PCs), and workload identities which are software-based objects (apps, VMs, services and containers)
- Hybrid identity > common identity for authentication and authorisation to all resources, regardless of location
- In Microsoft Entra ID, conditional access is a feature that provides an extra layer of security before allowing authenticated users to access data or other assets. Conditional access policy analyses signals including user, location, device, application and risk to automate decisions for authorising access to resources (apps and data)
- When admins create conditional access policy, the assignments portion of the policy controls who, what, where and when of the Conditional Access policy. All assignments are logically ANDed
- Global Secure Access protects internet-based resources running in private cloud or on-prem infra
- Microsoft Entra Private Access blocks lateral attack movement, reduce excessive access and replace legacy VPNs. For a given set of private resources to be secured, a new enterprise application that serves as a container for those private resources is set up
- Microsoft Entra Internet Access provides identity-centric secure web gateway solution for SaaS apps and has traffic logs. Key features include protection against user identity or token theft by using Conditional Access policies, tenant restrictions to prevent data exfiltration, internet access traffic forwarding profile policies and web content filtering
- Global Secure Access dashboard provides visualisations of network traffic acquired by Microsoft Entra Private and Microsoft Entra Internet Access services
- Microsoft Entra roles > Built-in roles (Global administrator, user administrator, billing administrator), custom roles
