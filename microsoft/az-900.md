### Microsoft Azure Fundamentals: Describe cloud concepts
- Cloud models:
  - Hybrid cloud > uses both public and private clouds in an inter-connected environment
  - Multi-cloud > multiple public cloud providers
  - Azure Arc > set of tech that helps manage cloud environments
  - Azure VMware Solution > migrate VMware workloads from private to public/hybrid cloud
- Benefits of cloud services:
  - Cloud has high availability (uptime) and high scalability (scale on demand)
  - Vertical scaling > Add more CPUs or RAM for processing power
  - Horizontal scaling > Add additional VMs or containers
  - Reliability > ability of system to recover from failures and continue to function
- Cloud manageability:
  - Cloud has a decentralised design (regions around the world)
  - Performance predictability > predicting resources needed to deliver a positive experience for customers (Autoscaling, load balancing and high availability)
  - Cost predictability > forecasting the cost of cloud spending (Cloud analytics, Pricing Calculator, Total Cost of Ownership (TCO))
  - Cloud features support governance and compliance
  - Cloud is managed through web portal, CLI, APIs and PowerShell
- Cloud service types:
  - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) > cloud provider maintains hardware, network connectivity and physical security. You are responsible for everything else: OS installation, configuration and maintenance; network configuration; database and storage configuration and so on
  - Scenarios for IaaS > Lift-and-shift migration, testing and development
  - Platform as a Service (PaaS) > cloud provider does all in IaaS and maintains OS, middleware, development tools and business intelligence services
  - Scenarios for PaaS > Development framework, analytics or business intelligence
  - Software as a Service (SaaS) > renting or using a fully developed application. Is the least flexible but easiest to run
  - Scenarios for SaaS > Email and messaging, business productivity applications, finance and expense tracking


### Microsoft Azure Fundamentals: Describe Azure architecture and services
- Azure physical infrastructure:
  - Datacenters are grouped into Azure Regions or Azure Availability Zones
  - Region is a geographical area that contains at least one or more datacenters that are nearby and networked together with a low-latency network
  - Availability zones are physically separate datacenters within an Azure region. Each AZ is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling and networking. An availability zone is set up to be an isolation boundary. If one zone goes down, the other continues working. AZ are connected through high-speed, private fiber-optic networks
  - AZ are primarily for VMs, managed disks, load balancers and SQL databases. Has 3 categories:
    - Zonal services (pin the resource to a specific zone)
    - Zone-redundant services (platform replicates automatically across zones)
    - Non-regional services (services are always available from Azure geographies and are resilient to zone-wide outages as well as region-wide outages)
  - Region pairs > Azure regions paired with another region within the same geography at least 300 miles away to allow for replication of resources across a geography that helps reduce the likelihood of interruptions that affects an entire region
  - If an extensive Azure outage occurs, 1 region out of every pair is prioritised to make sure at least one is restored quickly as possible for applications hosted in that region pair. Planned Azure updates are rolled out to paired regions one region at a time to minimise downtime. Data continues to reside within the same geography as its pair for tax- and law-enforcement jurisdiction purposes
  - Sovereign regions are instances of Azure that are isolated from the main instance of Azure (US DoD Central, US Gov Virginia, US Gov Iowa, and China East, China North (maintained through a unique partnership between MS and 21Vianet))
- Azure management infrastructure:
  - Resource > anything created, provisioned and deployed
  - Resource groups are groupings of resource. Actions applied to the group applies to all resources within the resource group
  - Azure accounts can have multiple subscriptions to configure different billing models and apply different access-management policies
  - 2 types of subscription boundaries:
    - Billing boundary (determines how an Azure account is billed for using Azure, and create multiple subscriptions for different types of billing requirements)
    - Access control boundary (applies access-management policies at subscription level, and create separate subscriptions to reflect different organisational structures)
  - Usage of management groups > create a hierarchy that applies a policy and provide user access to multiple subscriptions (using Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) means children inherit parent permissions)
  - 10000 management groups can be supported in a single directory
  - A management group tree can support up to 6 levels of depth
  - Each management group and subscription can support only 1 parent
- Azure VMs:
  - VM scale sets > Azure automates creation and managing of identical, load-balanced VMs
  - VM availability sets > ensure VMs stagger updates and have varied power and network connectivity, preventing losing all VMs with a single network or power failure. Has no additional cost
  - Update domain > groups VMs that can be rebooted at the same time. This setup allows applying updates while knowing that only one update domain grouping is offline at a time
  - Fault domain > groups VMs by common power source and network switch
- Azure Virtual Desktop:
  - Provides centralised security management for users' desktops with Microsoft Entra ID
  - Can enable MFA to secure user sign-ins and can assign granular RBAC to users
  - Data and apps are separated from local hardware because they run in the cloud
- Azure Container:
  - Containers are used in microservice architecture. Front-end, back-end and storage each have separate containers
  - Azure Container Instances > simplest way to run container in Azure without managing VMs or additional services, supports PaaS, allows container uploads for service to run the containers
  - Azure Container Apps > does not have container management piece, supports PaaS and incorporates load balancing and scaling
  - Azure Kubernetes Service > orchestration service to manage container lifecycle
- Azure Functions:
  - Event-driven, serverless compute that does not require maintaining VM or containers
  - Used only when concerned about code running service and not about underlying platform or infrastructure
  - Commonly used when work is response to an event (often via a REST request), timer, or message from another Azure service
  - Azure Functions runs code when it triggers and automatically deallocates resources when the function is finished. Azure charges for CPU time used while function runs
  - Stateless (default) functions behave as if they restart everytime they respond to an event
  - Stateful (Durable Functions) functions have context passing through to track prior activity
- Azure application hosting options:
  - Azure App Service > HTTP-based service for building and hosting web apps, background jobs, mobile backends and RESTful APIs without managing infra
- Azure virtual networking:
  - Allows creation of multiple isolated virtual networks. Define a private IP address space using public/private IP address ranges and is not internet routable. Can use Azure's name resolution service or internal/external DNS server
  - Internet communications are enabled by assigning a public IP address to Azure resource or putting the resource behind a load balancer
  - Communication between Azure resources can be done using virtual networks or service endpoints
  - Communication with on-prem resources through 3 mechanisms:
    - Point-to-site VPN (from external computer back into corporate network)
    - Site-to-site VPN (on-prem VPN device/gateway to Azure VPN gateway. Devices in Azure appear as being on local network)
    - Azure ExpressRoute (private connection to Azure that doesn't travel over the internet. Great bandwidth and high levels of security)
  - Route network traffic > Custom route tables or BGP that works with Azure VPN gateways, Azure Route Server or Azure ExpressRoute
  - Filter network traffic > Network security groups or network virtual appliances (specialised VMs like a hardened network appliance. Carries out a particular network function like running firewall or performing WAN optimisation)
  - Peering > 2 virtual networks connect directly to each other. Network traffic is private and travels on Microsoft backbone network, not through public internet. Allows user-defined routes (UDR)
- Azure VPN:
  - VPN Gateway instances are deployed in dedicated subnet of virtual network and enable site-to-site, point-to-site and network-to-network connection. Has 2 types: policy-based or route-based
  - Policy-based VPN gateways > specify statically the IP address of packets that should be encrypted through each tunnel
  - Route-based VPN gateways > IPSec tunnels are modeled as network interface or virtual tunnel interface. Preferred connection method for on-prem devices, more resilient to topology changes such as new subnet creation. Used for connections between virtual networks, point-to-site connections, multisite connections and coexistence with an Azure ExpressRoute gateway
  - High-availability scenarios:
    - Active/standby (when active instance is disrupted, standby instance automatically assumes responsibility)
    - Active/active (due to support for BGP routing protocol, each instance has unique public IP address with separate tunnels from on-prem devices to each IP address)
    - ExpressRoute failover (configure VPN gateway as secure failover path for ExpressRoute connections, but not immune to physical problems)
    - Zone-redundant gateways (Used in regions that support AZ. It uses different gateway stock keeping units (SKUs) and use Standard public IP address instead of Basic public IP addresses)
- Azure ExpressRoute:
  - Extends on-prem networks into Microsoft cloud over a private connection with help of connectivity provider (ExpressRoute Circuit)
  - Benefits of using ExpressRoute > connectivity to Microsoft cloud services across all regions in geopolitical region, global connectivity to Microsoft services across all regions with ExpressRoute Global Reach, dynamic routing between network and Microsoft via BGP and built-in redundancy in every peering location for higher reliability
  - ExpressRoute connectivity models > colocation at a cloud exchange, point-to-point Ethernet connection, any-to-any networks, directly from ExpressRoute sites
- Azure DNS:
  - Hosting service for DNS domains that provides name resolution by using Microsoft Azure infrastructure
  - Benefits > Reliability and performance, security, ease of use, customisable virtual networks with private domains, alias records (will update itself during DNS resolution if IP address of underlying resource changes)

    - Hot tier > Online tier optimized for storing data that is accessed or modified frequently. Has the highest storage costs, but the lowest access costs
    - Cool tier > Online tier optimized for storing data that is infrequently accessed or modified. Data in the cool tier should be stored for a minimum of 30 days. Has lower storage costs and higher access costs compared to the hot tier
    - Cold tier > Online tier optimized for storing data that is rarely accessed or modified, but still requires fast retrieval. Data in the cold tier should be stored for a minimum of 90 days. Has lower storage costs and higher access costs compared to the cool tier
    - Archive tier > Offline tier optimized for storing data that is rarely accessed, and that has flexible latency requirements, on the order of hours. Data in the archive tier should be stored for a minimum of 180 days
  - Azure storage redundancy:
    - Locally redundant storage (LRS - replicates data 3x within a single data center in primary region. Lowest-cost and least durability)
    - Zone-redundant storage (ZRS - replicates Azure storage data synchronously across 3 Azure AZ in primary region. Recommended for scenarios that require high availability)
    - Redundancy in a secondary region (Copy data to secondary region hundreds of miles away from primary region. This has 2 options: GRS (geo-redundant storage which is similar to running LRS in 2 regions) and GZRS (geo-zone-redundant storage which is similar to running ZRS in primary region and LRS in secondary region))
    - Geo-redundant storage (GRS - copies data synchronously 3 times within single physical location in primary region using LRS and copies data asnychronously to a single physical location in the secondary region)
    - Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS - data is copied across 3 Azure AZ in primary region and is replicated to a secondary geographic region)
  - Azure Blobs > massively scalable object store for text and binary data, includes support for big data analytics through Data Lake Storage Gen2. Is not limited to common file formats. Access tier includes Hot access tier (frequently accessed data), Cool access tier 
  - Azure Files > managed file shares in the cloud via SMB or NFS (Network File System) protocols. Can be mounted concurrently by cloud or on-prem deployments
  - Azure Queues > stores large numbers of messages accessible via HTTP/HTTPS. Used to create backlog of work to process asynchronously. Can be combined with compute functions like Azure Functions to take action when message is received
  - Azure Disks > Block-level storage volumes for use with Azure VMs, virtualised physical disk
  - Azure Tables > stores large amounts of structured data, is a NoSQL datastore that accepts authenticated calls from inside and outside the Azure cloud. Ideal for storing structured, non-relational data

- Microsoft Purview:
  - Family of data governance, risk, and compliance solutions that helps get a single, unified view into data
  - Brings insights about on-prem, multicloud and SaaS data together
- Azure Policy:
  - Service in Azure that enables creation, assignment and management of policies that control or audit resources
  - Enables definition of individual and groups of related policies, known as initiatives. It evaluates resources and highlights noncompliant resources, and can prevent noncompliant resources from being created. It can be set at each level and is inherited within parent-child groupings
- Resource Locks:
  - Prevents resources from being accidentally modified or deleted
  - Types of resource locks > Delete (authorised users can still read and modify a resource, but cannot delete a resource) and ReadOnly (authorised users can read a resource, but cannot delete or update the resource)
- Microsoft Service Trust Portal:
  - Portal that provides access to various content, tools, and other resources about Microsoft security, privacy, and compliance practices
- Azure resource management:
  - Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI
  - Azure Arc > centralised, unified way to manage environment together by projecting existing non-Azure resources into Azure Resource Manager (ARM), manage multi-cloud and hybrid VMs, Kubernetes clusters and DB as if they are running in Azure, use familiar Azure services regardless where they live, continue using traditional ITOps while introducing DevOps practices, and configuring custom locations as an abstraction layer on top of Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters and cluster extensions
  - Azure Resource Manager (ARM) > management layer for creating, updating and deleting resources in Azure account. ARM templates and Bicep are IaaC. Benefits are declarative syntax, repeatable results, orchestration, modular files and extensibility
- Azure monitoring tools:
