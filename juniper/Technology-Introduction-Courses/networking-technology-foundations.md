# Networking Technology Foundations


<details>
  <summary>The World Is Powered by Networks</summary>

### What Is a Network
- A network is a connection of 2 or more devices that enables them to share resources like applications and data
- Wired connection: connect to a network using a cable and send electrical or light pulses to transmit data
- Wireless connection: use radio waves
- Wired network connections are better in terms of security, speed and reliability
- Disadvantages of mobile wireless connection: If not close to cell tower, network performance can suffer. Can be affected by network congestion
- Devices in a typical network:
  - Host Devices: Computers, servers
  - Switches [Square]: Connect computers and servers to network 
  - Routers [Round]: Connect switches together and enable internet access 
  - Firewalls [Rectangular bricks]: Operate similar to routers, but provide advanced security 
- Interface are also known as ports
  - Hosts usually have 1 or 2 ports
  - Switches have many ports to connect hosts together
  - Routers connect switches together and provide internet access, less number of ports than switches
- Network devices use OS to enable network engineers to configure devices
- Juniper Networks OS = Junos OS. Configuration syntax is same across all Junos OS devices
- J-Web is the GUI for Junos OS


### PANs, LANs, CANs, MANs, and WANs
- PAN: Personal (individual)
- LAN: Local (building)
- CAN: Campus (multiple interconnected buildings)
- MAN: Metropolitan (city)
- WAN: Wide (global)


### A Closer Look at Very Large Networks
- Cloud = data center
- Data uploaded/downloaded when surfing the net is stored on servers
- The internet is a mesh of networks (network of networks)
- Branches of networking:
  - Wireless
  - Data Center
  - Security
  - Service Provider
  - Cellular
  - Enterprise

  <summary>Data Transmission in a Network</summary>

### Data Transmission and the Post Office
- To prevent file corruption during transmision, computer breaks up the file into smaller pieces of data and resends it if one piece becomes corrupted. There's no need to resend the file
- Information for data transmission:
  - The data itself
  - Address information
  - Transport information
  - Transit handling
- Write recipient of letter on envelope and mail to nearest office
- A new address will be added to the envelope which will be the next address of the sorting center until it reaches intended destination
- 


### Data Transmission on the Source Device
